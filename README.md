# SubChange

A command line tool to help myself automate some process for subtitle (ASS) files:

- Flip double-line subtitle, mainly for changing Chinese-English subtitle into English-Chinese. During this process, it will also change the default style.
- Rename subtitle according to media filename, and copy it to remote server where media stored.
- It can handle single file or multiple files, for example a season of TV shows.
- Some other file manipulations like extract subtitle files from subdirectories, rename a season of subtitles with format S00E00.
